  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>I train the next generation of data scientists.</strong> 
    As a professor, I have trained hundreds of undergraduates, dozens of graduate students,
    and even several other faculty in how to think about, analyze, visualize, and
    report their data. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    <strong>My area of focus</strong> uses data science to understand decision making 
    by integrates biology, psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and economics.
    I employ open science practices to ensure that my work is transparent, accessible, and reproducible.
